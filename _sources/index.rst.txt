Overview
########

MOCAP4ROS2 is a project his project provides support for ROS2 integration with Vicon cameras (MOCAP systems based on vision) and Technaid TechMCS IMUs (MOCAP systems based on motion sensors).

The project MOCAP4ROS2 is funded as a Focused Technical Project by ROSIN.

To learn more about this project, such as related projects, and maintainers, see :ref:`about`.

We hope that this software helps to include planning in more Robotics projects, offering simple and powerful software to 
generate intelligent behaviors for robots.

We want to invite you to contribute to this `Open Source project in GitHub <https://github.com/MOCAP4ROS2-Project>`_ !!
