Getting Started
===============================

Currently, the MOCAP4ROS2 packages are not available as Debian packages in any ROS 2 distribution; therefore, you must install them from source. The main branches of each repository usually point to the latest distribution available on ROS2.

MOCAP4ROS2 supports motion capture systems, most of which are commercial. Typically, you should proceed to one of the sections that explain how to install and configure your specific system. However, for this "getting started" section, we will use the driver for Gazebo.

This section provides a step-by-step approach for setting up and running the MOCAP4ROS2 simulation environment. Please follow these instructions carefully to ensure a smooth setup.

1. Clone the Repositories

Begin by cloning the necessary repositories into your ``src`` folder inside your workspace (e.g., ``mocap4r2_ws``):

.. code-block:: console

    git clone -b jazzy-devel https://github.com/MOCAP4ROS2-Project/mocap4ros2_gazebo.git

2. Install Dependencies

To install all required dependencies, use the `.repos` file provided:

.. code-block:: console

    vcs import < mocap4ros2_gazebo/dependency_repos.repos

Make sure you are updated:

.. code-block:: console

    rosdep update
    sudo apt-get update

.. code-block:: console
      
    cd .. && rosdep install --from-paths src --ignore-src -r -y

1. Build the Workspace

Once the repositories and dependencies are in place, build the workspace using `colcon`:

.. code-block:: console

    colcon build --symlink-install

4. Launch the Simulator  with "a marker". Remember to use the "2D Pose Estimate" tool in Rviz2 (in toolbar) to set the robot position (it is around (X: -2, Y: -0.5, Yaw: 0.0) ).

Source your workspace and launch the TurtleBot3 simulation with the following commands:

.. code-block:: console

    source install/setup.bash
    ros2 launch mocap4r2_gz_plugin tb3_simulation_launch.py headless:=False

.. |image1| image:: images/getting_started_4_a.png
   :width: 400px
   :align: middle

.. |image2| image:: images/getting_started_4_b.png
   :width: 400px
   :align: middle

+----------+----------+
| |image1| + |image2| +
+----------+----------+

This will automatically open Gazebo:

.. |image3| image:: images/getting_started_4c.png
   :width: 500px
   :align: middle

+----------+
| |image3| +
+----------+

5. Run RQT Gui and Load the MocapControl Plugin


Execute the following command to run the RQT GUI and load the MocapControl plugin:

.. code-block:: console

    ros2 run rqt_gui rqt_gui --force-discover

.. |image4| image:: images/getting_started_5.png
   :width: 400px
   :align: middle

+----------+
| |image4| +
+----------+

6. Start MocapControl

Press the "Start" button in MocapControl and check that markers and rigid bodies are being published:

.. code-block:: console

    ros2 topic echo /markers

.. code-block:: console

    ros2 topic echo /rigid_bodies

7. Execute the Ground Truth Program

To run the ground truth program, use the following command:

.. code-block:: console

    ros2 run mocap4r2_robot_gt gt_program --ros-args -p robot_frame:=map

Check in Rviz how a new frame, `base_footprint_gt` exists and it is the real robot position. Move the robot and see how this TF track the robot position.


Press the button "Stop" in MocapControl to stop the gazebo mocap.
